"""
dddb-specific routines for operating "locally".

This assumes that the server (or some other source of messages) has access
to the local folders that the agent reads message from and writes messaages to. 
This is useful in single-device demonstrations of DeadDrop, as well as remote
demonstrations of DeadDrop that do not involve an actual remote service.
